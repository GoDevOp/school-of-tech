# CSE â€” The Game

My Senior year Spring quarter side project. My goal is to incorporate the material I learned in each of my computer science classes in some part of the development of the game.

---

A game about running a computer science and engineering (CSE) department. You are the department chair and your job is to make your CSE department as successful as possible by completing the missions.
